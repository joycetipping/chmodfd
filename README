chmodfd - chmod files and directories separately

USAGE:

  chmodfd [options]... [PATH]

DESCRIPTION:

  Recursively chmods PATH (current directory by default), setting
  file permissions to FMASK and directory permissions to DMASK. By
  default, it chmods all files first and then all directories; this
  can be reversed by using the B<-D> flag.

OPTIONS:

  -f=FMASK
  Specifies the file permission mask. Default value is 644.

  -d=DMASK
  Specifies the directory permission mask. Default value is 755.

  -D
  Chmod directories before files. Usually, it won't matter
  whether the files or the directories come first. However, in
  cases when the executable bit is being added back to the
  directories, the script will not be able to access the files
  until the directories permissions are changed.
